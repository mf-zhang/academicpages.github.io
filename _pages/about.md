I'm a PhD student at the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. [Yoichi Sato](https://sites.google.com/ut-vision.org/ysato/), expecting to graduate in March 2026. Previously, I received my Master degree from the Univerisity of Tokyo in 2023 and my BSc degree from Nanjing University in 2020.

My research interests lie in human computer interaction, computer vision, and AR/MR. Currently my research mainly focuses on egocentric vision and hand-related tasks. Previously, I was studying gaze estimation during my master program.
